# EVC-Transfer-Tool
Allows for save transferring of Everybody Votes Channel save data from RiiConnect24 to WiiLink

## Why is this needed?
The Everybody Votes Channel saves all current and past polls in a save file. It is the former which is a problem for us. If you were to convert from RiiConnect24 to WiiLink right now, your RC24 polls would remain. They would remain until they expire, which then the channel will prompt us to download the results, which for obvious reasons we do not have. The only other way to mitigate this is to delete your save file, which for many people is not preferable as there is poll history.

## What does it do?
Simply put, it removes the RiiConnect24 polls to allow for WiiLink polls without touching anything else.
